# Still to do

 * Update NOTES.md
   * Clean up things that are exist, but are just plain messy.
   * Document important common structs, like the sprites and players.
   * Maybe write up as outline of the AI
 * Have I got the A/B/C button order incorrect?
 * What's going on with X and Y bumps on the sprites? 

# Further work

 * Deal with calls to `draw_training_background`
  * Identify 2x2 maps
  * Update extractors to handle it.
 * Similarly, extract the 4x4 tiles that make up the pitch, and build
   a full image of the pitch.
 * Give an outline of how the AI works in NOTES.md
 * Reproduce the AI behaviour as a kind of demo?

# Loose ends

Anything containing "TODO" or "unk".
